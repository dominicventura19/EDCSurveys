# Objective

The Sarasota Economic Development Corporation sends out a yearly survey to every business in Sarasota. The questions ask about the number of employees, 
the business name, the address, satisfication with the community, etc... Our task was to create a csv of the survey information and perform some exploratory data 
analysis on it and find some insights into Sarasota businesses for the EDC and if businesses were unhappy in anyway, they could reach out and help.
